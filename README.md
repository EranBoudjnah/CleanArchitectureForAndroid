# Clean Architecture for Android Sample Project

This project is a loose implementation of Clean Architecture as presented in my
book,  [Clean Architecture for Android](https://amzn.to/43cUuhb). It is a native Android project
written in Kotlin.

It demonstrates the key principles presented in the book and how they apply to a real life project.
I will endeavour to keep this project up to date and use it to demonstrate the strengths of the
architecture: scalability, testability and flexibility when it comes to choosing 3rd party
solutions.
